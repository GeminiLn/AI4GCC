Welcome to Team Ravenclaw's repository for the AI4GCC competition! In this repository, you'll find our implementation of negotiation strategies in the rice.py file. Our modeling training and testing procedures adhere to the settings provided by the [original repository](https://github.com/mila-iqia/climate-cooperation-competition).

Due to the page limitation in the final report, we've included our results below for your reference:
